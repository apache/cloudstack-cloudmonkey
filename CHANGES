Version 5.1.0
=============
This release includes
 - support for using username and password instead of / in addition to api key and secret key
 - Usage of signature version 3 for the api signing process. This reduces the chance of API replay attacks
 - cleanup based on reporting from PEP8 and Flake8

If you upgrade from 5.0, then cloudmonkey will ask you to update your config file (~/.cloudmonkey/config)
Under the [user], you can add
username =
password =
Under the [server], you can add
expires = 600

Version 5.0.0
=============
This is the first release of CloudMonkey independent from the Apache CloudStack core orchestration engine. The release
includes a precache of Apache CloudStack 4.2.0 API calls, and should be backward compatible with prior 3.x and 4.x
CloudStack installations (with the obvious caveat that previous versions will have a subset of the latest API commands /
parameters).
