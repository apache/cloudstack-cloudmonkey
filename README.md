## CloudMonkey [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey)[![](https://images.microbadger.com/badges/version/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey)[![cloudmonkey](https://snapcraft.io/cloudmonkey/badge.svg)](https://snapcraft.io/cloudmonkey)

`cloudmonkey` :cloud::monkey_face: is a command line interface (CLI) for
[Apache CloudStack](http://cloudstack.apache.org).
CloudMonkey can be used both as an interactive shell and as a command line tool
which simplifies Apache CloudStack configuration and management.

The modern cloudmonkey is a re-written and simplified port in Go and can be used
with Apache CloudStack 4.9 and above. The legacy cloudmonkey written in Python
can be used with Apache CloudStack 4.0-incubating and above.

For documentation, kindly see the [wiki](https://github.com/apache/cloudstack-cloudmonkey/wiki).

### Development

For development the pre-requisites are Go 1.11 or latest and a unix-like
environment. You can use the following targets for building:

    $ make help

      all             Build program binary
      test-bench      Run benchmarks
      test-short      Run only short tests
      test-verbose    Run tests in verbose mode with coverage reporting
      test-race       Run tests with race detector
      check tests     Run tests
      test-xml        Run tests with xUnit output
      test-coverage   Run coverage tests
      debug           Runs a debuggable binary using dlv
      lint            Run golint
      fmt             Run gofmt on all source files

Build and run:

    $ make run

Build and run manually:

    $ make all
    $ ./bin/cmk

### History

The original `cloudmonkey` was written in Python and contributed to Apache
CloudStack project by [Rohit Yadav](http://rohityadav.cloud) on 31 Oct 2012
under the Apache License 2.0. The Python-based original CLI is now referred to
as the legacy cloudmonkey and can be installed using `pip install cloudmonkey`.

Starting version 6.0.0, the modern cloudmonkey `cmk` is a fast and simplified
Go-port of the original tool with some backward incompatibilities and reduced
feature set. It ships as a standalone 64-bit executable binary for several
platforms such as Linux, Mac and Windows.

**NOTE:**

If cloudmonkey is being upgraded from a version lower than v6.0.0, it must be noted
that the cloudmonkey configuration path is changed from `~/.cloudmonkey/config` to 
`~/.cmk/config` and a default `localcloud` profile is created. One would have to hence
do an initial setup of basic configuration such apikey/secretkey/username/password/url for the required profile(s) as required
